# Portfolio

This is the portfolio for Qiushi Pan.

## Road map

I will make this available for other people, so that they can use it easily by just filling their info.

## Quick start

Although it is not anonymized yet, you can start using it.

Inside `web` is the main web page build in Next.js.
We use pnpm to manage packages.

You will want to install packages for the first time.

```sh
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Install packages and you are good to go.

You can also start the dev server from the root directory.

```sh
make dev
```

Happy hacking!
